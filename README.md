# Multi-Label Graph Learning for Metabolic Pathway (MLGL-MP) Prediction framework
Multi-Label Graph Learning
Framework enhanced by Pathway Inter-dependence for Metabolic Pathway Prediction is a novel framework to make full use of available metabolic pathway data, which can learn the task for Metabolic Pathway prediction. Here is the overview of the MLGL-MP framework.


# Step-by-step running:

## 1. Requirements
+ Python == 3.8
+ PyTorch == 1.8.0
+ scikit-learn == 0.24.2
+ pandas == 1.2.0
+ numpy == 1.20.2
+ rdkit 
+ Jupyter Notebook
+ Install pytorch_geometric following instruction at https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric

## 2. Dataset
A dataset of 6669 compounds named "kegg_classes.txt" in dataset belonging to one or more of these 11 constituent pathway types was adopted from [1].

10-fold cross-validation is used for the 6648 compounds (which can be converted to molecular graph).

## 3. Create data 
3.1 Pathway embeddings

Running Pathway_Embedding.ipynb in Pre-training to obtain Pathway_Embedding.pkl as the node features in Pathway Dependence Graph.

3.2 Pathway Dependence Matrix 

Run adj_file.ipynb in "Dataset / Data_10-fold cross validation / fold x" and obtain adj.pkl as edges in Pathway Dependence Graph.

3.3 Obtain pytorch format data

Running
```sh
python create_data.py
```
train.csv and test.csv in data are input to create data in pytorch format,
stored at data/processed/, consisting of train.pt and test.pt.
# Usage
MLGL-MP-(fold-1) is used as a example to obtain the result and other folds are similar.
```sh
python Training.py
```
In the case study, we used 1 of 6 as the example, attention weights learned in GAT layer are captured and output by using gat_att_weights and gat_edge_indx. After that, the tensor of gat_att_weights and gat_edge_indx are used to attention.ipynb to visualize the important substructures of compounds.
